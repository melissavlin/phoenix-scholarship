*note: a work in progress

A web application for an organization's scholarship program.
Personally made for a greek organization, actives (members that are still in college) can apply using the form provided.
Alumni can access their page and make a pledge to contribute to the scholarship fund.
Only when he/she donates can an Alum become a member of the scholarship committee. A board member has the ability to view all applications and vote for their applicant of choice for the semester.

There is also an appointed chairperson (only 1 user can have this role). This chair person has the capabilities of a board member and the private ability to see who has contributed to the scholarship fund. When the chairperson receives payment, he/she will be able to mark that the contributer has paid.
